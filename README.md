# Scientific Computing with Python (Beta) - FreeCodeCamp Projects

## Case Converter Program

### Overview
This project focuses on writing a Python program that converts strings formatted in Camel Case or Pascal Case into Snake Case. The implementation is done in two phases. Initially, a for loop is used to achieve the conversion, followed by a demonstration of achieving the same results using List Comprehension.

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the "case_converter" directory.
3. Run the program using a Python interpreter:

    ```bash
    python case_converter.py
    ```

## Expense Tracker

### Overview
This project explores the capabilities of Lambda Functions in Python by creating a simple yet efficient expense tracker. The resulting application demonstrates the use of Lambda Functions for streamlined operations in the context of an expense tracking system.

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the "expense_tracker" directory.
3. Run the program using a Python interpreter:

    ```bash
    python expense_tracker.py
    ```

## Implementing Luhn Algorithm

### Overview
The Luhn Algorithm is a widely used error-checking method, often employed in verifying credit card numbers. This project provides hands-on experience in working with numerical computations and string manipulation while implementing the Luhn Algorithm.

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the "luhn_algorithm" directory.
3. Run the program using a Python interpreter:

    ```bash
    python luhn_algorithm.py
    ```

## Building Cipher

### Overview
In this project, fundamental programming concepts in Python, including variables, functions, loops, and conditional statements, are applied to build a basic cipher. The goal is to provide a practical introduction to these programming constructs through the implementation of simple encryption techniques.

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the "building_cipher" directory.
3. Run the program using a Python interpreter:

    ```bash
    python building_cipher.py
    ```
